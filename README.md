# `evil.sh` (aka. `devili.sh`)

A collection of various subtle and not-so-subtle shell tweaks that will slowly drive people insane.

Feel like trolling a colleague? Just add `source ~/evil.sh` to their `.bash_profile` and watch the chaos ensue.
Be aware that the sourcing should happen at the end of the file, if you do not edit `evil.sh` before doing so, as `evil.sh` disables `alias` and `unalias`.

## Contributions

Evil suggestions and pull requests are welcome. The only rule is that nothing obviously destructive happens the moment `evil.sh` is sourced. Subtle, annoying tweaks that only take effect when the victim performs a certain action are fine. On the other hand, a patch that adds `rm -rfv /` to `evil.sh` will be rejected.
