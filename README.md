# `devili.sh`

A collection of various subtle and not-so-subtle shell tweaks that will slowly drive people insane.

Feel like trolling a colleague? Just add `source ~/devili.sh` to their `.bash_profile` and watch the chaos ensue.

## Contributions

Evil suggestions and pull requests are welcome. The only rule is that nothing obviously destructive happens the moment `devili.sh` is sourced. Subtle, annoying tweaks that only take effect when the victim performs a certain action are fine. On the other hand, a patch that adds `rm -rfv /` to `devili.sh` will be rejected.
